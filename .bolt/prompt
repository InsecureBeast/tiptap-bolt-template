By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

Use icons from lucide-react for logos.

**RULES**
1. Change only 1 file in public folder - data.json! 
3. If I ask you to add some text or change it write your answer in the content variable in the data.json file.
  
Add .env file when start first time
